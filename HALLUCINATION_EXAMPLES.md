# Hallucination Detection and Mitigation Examples

This document provides comprehensive examples of how hallucination detection and mitigation is implemented in Contour AI.

## Overview

Hallucinations in AI systems occur when the model generates information that is not supported by the provided context or training data. Our implementation includes multiple detection strategies and mitigation techniques.

## Detection Strategies

### 1. Factual Consistency Check

**Purpose**: Detect uncertain language and potential fabrication indicators

**Example Detection**:
```javascript
// Input response with uncertainty indicators
const response = "I think the API probably returns user data, but it might be encrypted.";

// Detection result
{
  type: 'factual',
  severity: 'medium',
  description: 'Response contains multiple uncertainty indicators',
  suggestion: 'Verify claims against knowledge base entries'
}
```

**Patterns Detected**:
- Uncertain language: "I think", "probably", "might be"
- Absolute claims: "always", "never", "completely"
- Speculation: "it's possible", "presumably", "allegedly"

### 2. Context Adherence Check

**Purpose**: Ensure responses stay within provided knowledge base context

**Example Detection**:
```javascript
// Knowledge base context about API authentication
const context = ["API uses Bearer token authentication", "Endpoint: /api/v1/users"];

// Response that goes beyond context
const response = "The API uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE extension and supports refresh tokens.";

// Detection result
{
  type: 'context',
  severity: 'high',
  description: 'Response contains significant information not found in context',
  suggestion: 'Limit responses to information available in knowledge base'
}
```

### 3. Confidence Level Check

**Purpose**: Flag responses with low AI confidence scores

**Example Detection**:
```javascript
// Low confidence response
const confidence = 0.45; // 45% confidence

// Detection result
{
  type: 'confidence',
  severity: 'high',
  description: 'Low AI confidence score: 45.0%',
  suggestion: 'Consider requesting more specific information'
}
```

### 4. Source Attribution Check

**Purpose**: Detect unsupported claims without proper context

**Example Detection**:
```javascript
// Response making claims without sources
const response = "Studies show that this API is the most secure in the industry.";
const context = []; // No context provided

// Detection result
{
  type: 'source',
  severity: 'high',
  description: 'Response makes claims without available source context',
  suggestion: 'Provide source attribution or qualify statements'
}
```

### 5. Internal Consistency Check

**Purpose**: Identify contradictory statements within the same response

**Example Detection**:
```javascript
// Contradictory response
const response = "The API is always available. However, it cannot be accessed during maintenance windows.";

// Detection result
{
  type: 'consistency',
  severity: 'high',
  description: 'Response contains contradictory statements',
  suggestion: 'Review and resolve conflicting information'
}
```

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Confidence-Based Filtering

**Low Confidence (< 50%)**:
```
⚠️ **Low Confidence Response** (45.0%)

[Original response]

*Please verify this information independently.*
```

**Medium Confidence (50-70%)**:
```
⚠️ **Medium Confidence Response** (65.0%)

[Original response]

*Consider cross-referencing with additional sources.*
```

### 2. Source Attribution

**With Sources**:
```
[Original response]

**Sources:**
1. API Authentication Documentation
2. User Management Endpoint Guide
```

**Without Sources**:
```
[Original response]

*No specific sources available - please verify independently.*
```

### 3. Uncertainty Quantification

**High Uncertainty**:
```
❌ **Low Confidence**

[Original response]

*This information requires verification - treat as preliminary.*
```

**Medium Uncertainty**:
```
⚠️ **Medium Confidence**

[Original response]

*This information should be verified with additional sources.*
```

**Low Uncertainty**:
```
✅ **High Confidence**

[Original response]

*This information is well-supported by available sources.*
```

## Real-World Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Knowledge Base + AI Mode

```javascript
// User asks: "How does the payment API handle refunds?"
// Knowledge base has: "Payment API supports transactions"
// AI generates: "The payment API handles refunds through a sophisticated machine learning algorithm that analyzes transaction patterns."

// Hallucination detected:
{
  isHallucination: true,
  confidence: 0.3,
  checks: [
    {
      type: 'context',
      severity: 'high',
      description: 'Response contains significant information not found in context'
    }
  ],
  warnings: ['This response may contain inaccurate information']
}

// Mitigated response:
"⚠️ **Accuracy Notice**: This response may contain unverified information.

The payment API handles refunds through a sophisticated machine learning algorithm that analyzes transaction patterns.

*Based on available knowledge base entries.*

**Suggestions for verification:**
• Limit responses to information available in knowledge base"
```

### Example 2: Pure AI Mode

```javascript
// User asks: "What's the capital of Mars?"
// AI generates: "The capital of Mars is New Geneva, established in 2157."

// Hallucination detected:
{
  isHallucination: true,
  confidence: 0.2,
  checks: [
    {
      type: 'factual',
      severity: 'high',
      description: 'Response contains potential hallucination indicators'
    }
  ]
}

// Mitigated response:
"🤖 **AI-Generated Response**

The capital of Mars is New Geneva, established in 2157.

⚠️ *This response is generated by AI and should be verified independently. For more reliable information, try using Knowledge Base mode with verified sources.*

❌ **Low Confidence**

*This information requires verification - treat as preliminary.*"
```

### Example 3: Local LLM Mode

```javascript
// User asks about API rate limits
// Context: "API allows 1000 requests per hour"
// Local LLM generates: "The API has a rate limit of 1000 requests per hour, and it uses advanced quantum computing to process requests faster than traditional servers."

// Hallucination detected:
{
  isHallucination: true,
  confidence: 0.4,
  checks: [
    {
      type: 'context',
      severity: 'medium',
      description: 'Response contains information not found in context'
    }
  ]
}

// Mitigated response:
"The API has a rate limit of 1000 requests per hour, and it uses advanced quantum computing to process requests faster than traditional servers.

🖥️ **Local AI Response** (Confidence: 40.0%)
*This response is generated by a local AI model and should be verified independently.*"
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Console Output Examples

```javascript
// Successful detection
console.log('Hallucination Detection Result:', {
  isHallucination: true,
  confidence: 0.45,
  checks: [
    {
      type: 'factual',
      severity: 'high',
      description: 'Response contains potential hallucination indicators'
    }
  ],
  warnings: ['High confidence hallucination detected']
});

// Knowledge base validation
console.log('Knowledge Base Validation Result:', {
  isHallucination: false,
  confidence: 0.85,
  checks: [],
  warnings: []
});
```

### Real-time Streaming Monitoring

```javascript
// Monitor streaming responses for hallucinations
HallucinationDetector.monitorStreamingResponse(
  partialResponse,
  knowledgeBaseContext,
  (result) => {
    if (result.isHallucination) {
      console.warn('Hallucination detected during streaming:', result);
      // Could interrupt stream or add warning
    }
  }
);
```

## Configuration and Thresholds

### Adjustable Parameters

```javascript
// Confidence threshold for hallucination detection
const CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7; // 70%

// Severity levels
const SEVERITY_LEVELS = {
  LOW: 'low',      // Minor issues, informational
  MEDIUM: 'medium', // Moderate concerns, warnings
  HIGH: 'high'     // Serious issues, strong warnings
};

// Detection weights
const DETECTION_WEIGHTS = {
  FACTUAL_CONSISTENCY: 0.3,
  CONTEXT_ADHERENCE: 0.4,
  CONFIDENCE_LEVEL: 0.2,
  SOURCE_ATTRIBUTION: 0.1
};
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Layered Detection
- Use multiple detection strategies simultaneously
- Combine rule-based and statistical approaches
- Consider context-specific thresholds

### 2. Graceful Degradation
- Always provide the original response with warnings
- Offer suggestions for verification
- Maintain user experience while ensuring accuracy

### 3. Continuous Improvement
- Log detection results for analysis
- Adjust thresholds based on user feedback
- Update detection patterns regularly

### 4. User Education
- Clearly explain confidence levels
- Provide guidance on when to verify information
- Encourage critical thinking about AI responses

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Factual Hallucination
```javascript
const testResponse = "The API was created by aliens in 1847 using quantum technology.";
const result = HallucinationDetector.detectHallucination(testResponse, [], "When was the API created?");
// Expected: High severity hallucination detected
```

### Test Case 2: Context Deviation
```javascript
const context = ["API returns user profile data"];
const testResponse = "The API can also control smart home devices and order pizza.";
const result = HallucinationDetector.detectHallucination(testResponse, context, "What does the API do?");
// Expected: Context adherence violation
```

### Test Case 3: Low Confidence
```javascript
const testResponse = "I think maybe the API might possibly return some data.";
const result = HallucinationDetector.detectHallucination(testResponse, [], "What does the API return?", 0.3);
// Expected: Low confidence and uncertainty indicators
```

This comprehensive implementation ensures that Contour AI provides reliable, accurate information while maintaining transparency about the limitations and confidence levels of AI-generated responses.
